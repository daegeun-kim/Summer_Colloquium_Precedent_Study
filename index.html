            <p>Project Summary (what the author has written about the project):</p>
            <p>
            p5.js is a free, open-source JavaScript library designed to make coding accessible and intuitive, especially for artists, designers, educators, and beginners.<br><br>
            It emphasizes creativity, inclusivity, accessibility, and community, allowing users to create interactive, audio-visual, and experimental web-based works.<br><br>
            The platform supports iterative, sketch-like coding, offers extensive documentation and tutorials, and can be extended with community-built libraries. It encourages contribution and open-source participation, welcoming involvement in all forms

                Project Comments & Suggestions (what others have written about the project):<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Positive Comments:<br>
                <li>“p5.js and Processing.js are really for educational and artistic doodling… one of the best features… low cost prototyping”</li>
                <li>“I think Processing took off so much in the artistic community… p5.js just allows you to get stuff done.”</li>
                <br>
                Negative Comments:<br><br>
                <li>“p5.js runs slower than expected, especially when drawing many shapes or animations. They are asking if the library itself introduces unnecessary lag or inefficiencies”</li>
                <li>“Sketches run great in desktop browsers, but performance and speed on mobile devices is very slow”</li>
