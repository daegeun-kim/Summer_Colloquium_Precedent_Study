                Mike Bostock:<br>
                <br>
                “I'd say the motivation was to stop reinventing the wheel. The goal of D3 is to embrace and build on standard, universal representations of graphics, rather than reinvent them each time.”<br><br>
                “With D3, the idea is to leverage the native representation … the toolkit isn't a middleman, preventing you from using browser features.”<br><br>
                “By using D3, your code will be shorter and you'll be able to do more. … And better still, you'’'ll get human-readable ticks at multiples of 2, 5 or 10…” <br>

                Project Comments & Suggestions (what others have written about the project):<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Positive Comments:</b><br><br>
                “D3.js is an amazing library if your a designer. I have more flexibility with D3.js than any of the other libraries.”<br>
                “its great for hackathons tho. won one last year using D3”<br>
                "Users note D3’s vast repository of examples, modular architecture, and community support"<br>
                <br>
                <b>Negative Comments:</b><br>
                “One of the main disadvantages of D3.js is its steep learning curve and complexity.”<br>
                “For business analytics, close to zero value. Too low level. Pandas plot, seaborn, matplotlib does 99.9% of what is needed.”<br>
                “…you find yourself reaching in order to make something look cool, that isn’t actually effective.”<br>
                <br>
                <b>Suggestions</b><br>
                "Use Canvas or WebGL instead of SVG when rendering thousands of elements—greatly improves rendering speed"<br>
                "Build interactive UI components (filters, dropdowns, checkboxes) to let users dynamically adjust and explore data views"<br>
                "Provide annotation and templating tools so developers can automatically add tooltips, legends, labels consistently across charts"<br>
